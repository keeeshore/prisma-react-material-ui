# Welcome to the Brighte Referral App

This app provides a webapp to manage internal referrals fueled by a backend REST API.

Users can view a list of entries representing referrals to contact.

Currently, the app can only display existing entries, and we need to add more functionality to make sure our product
team can use it effectively.

## Overview

This app is written in Typescript using [Express](https://expressjs.com/) for the backend API
and [React](https://reactjs.org/) for the frontend.

### API

The backend logic is implemented as a REST API, located at `./apps/api`. A local sqlite relational database is used to
store the data and [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) is used to manage the schema and access the db.

### Webapp

The webapp code is located at `./apps/webapp`. It fetches data from the API and displays the referrals in a user
interface. The app uses [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) as UI component library.

This project was generated using [Nx](https://nx.dev).

## Local Development Setup

### Prerequisites

* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/), latest LTS version recommended
* [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) package manager, version 1.22.x or newer

Tip: a nice way to install and manage various versions of NodeJS on your development machine
is [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating).

On a Mac you can use [Brew](https://brew.sh/) to install all prerequisites with this command:

```shell
brew install nvm yarn
```

Note: You will get prompted with one additional manual task to finish the NVM installation.

### Setup and Run

#### Set and install Node version (when using NVM):

```shell
nvm install
node --version
```

#### Install dependencies:

```shell
yarn install
```

#### Init Database and run initial migration:

```shell
yarn prisma migrate deploy
```

This command initialises the SQLite database and generates the db client.

#### Start the API service:

```shell
yarn start api
```

#### Start the webapp (in a separate terminal):

```shell
yarn start webapp
```

#### You are all set üéâ

#### Run Tests

```shell
yarn test api       # runs the api tests
yarn test webapp    # runs the webapp tests
```

Open [localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) in your browser, you should see the webapp

Hint: to reset the database to its default state, run this from the root of the project:

```shell
rm ./apps/api/prisma/dev.db*  # removes SQLite files
yarn prisma migrate deploy    # rebuild db schema
```

## Tasks

Right now the app only provides a basic overview of existing entries of referrals, and the product team has asked us to
extend the app with some features.

Your job is to extend the app accordingly and make sure that the code base stays extendable and maintainable.

* Feel free to use any additional tools or libraries where you think it is appropriate.
* The existing code surely is not perfect, feel free to refactor things where it makes sense.
* Make sure that you follow best practices while extending the REST API and the webapp (e.g. code structure, SOLID
  principles etc.).
* Try to keep the user experience in mind while implementing new features. If requirements are unclear, feel free to
  decide what is best for the user.
* Add implementation notes and comments at the end of this README.

### Task 1: Update and delete referrals

The team needs to be able to update and delete existing referral entries. We already have action buttons in the UI that
are not functional yet, let's implement them.

* The update and delete functionality for the buttons in each referral row should be implemented.
* When clicking on the Delete icon, the user should be prompted with a confirmation dialog and only confirming it should
  delete records.
* To update a referral, a modal box should be used with prefilled form fields.
  Hint: [Material UI - Modal](https://material-ui.com/components/modal/)
* The entries should be updated or deleted in the database accordingly via the API.

### Task 2: Create new referral entries

Users of the app want to be able to create new referrals using a form. The dev team came up with the following
requirements:

* A `Create new` button should be added below the existing referral list.
* The button opens a modal box with a form including all relevant fields to create a new referral entry.
* At the bottom of the modal box there should be 2 buttons: `Cancel` and `Create`.
* A new entry should be created via the API when the form is filled correctly and the `Create` button is clicked.

### Task 3: Address

In order to get a better picture of where referrals are located we want to start capturing their addresses. We came up
with the following requirements for the webapp:

* The optional fields `addressLine`, `suburb`, `state`, `postCode` and `country` are already present in the database
  schema in the backend REST API, we just need to provide a nice UI to capture addresses and send those fields when
  creating or updating referrals.
* All address fields are now mandatory in the frontend and creating or updating entries should require all fields to be
  present.
* The product team didn't come up with details around the input form for addresses, but mentioned that it should be easy
  to fill out and ideally work with some autocomplete functionality.
* The address fields should be saved when creating and updating referral entries.

## Implementation Notes

* Only Update, Delete and Create Referrals works with basic backend validations


* No use of redux, or redux middlewares as the implementation is quite basic
* Use of react Context API
* Not implemented front end validations, and only basic backend validations added.  
* No use of sass.
* Task 3 is incomplete due to time constraints
* Incomplete test cases

Happy Coding üßë‚Äçüíª
